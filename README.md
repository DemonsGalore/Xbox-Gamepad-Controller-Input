# Xbox Gamepad/Controller Input

This is an example of how i managed to use the Jinput-library to get input-signals from an Xbox360-Controller. I wanted to get just a single impulse, if i trigger a button/stick, which is working for me so far. It may not be the best solution, but it's working for me and i wanted to share my solution if anyone else has problems getting started with Jinput like myself.
*Note: There are probably some issues, if both analog-sticks are used at the same time.*
